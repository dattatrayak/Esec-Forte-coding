----------------------------------------------------------------------

General Rules:

1: For bonus point avoid using in-built function.

2: Preferred lang is PHP/JS

3: Plz provide full file of the code which can be executed to check the output.

4: Any assumptions shall be clearly highlighted.

 

 

Q1: Convert String to Camel Case:

 

Write Function which converts input String into camel casing and use delimiter also as per input. Capitalize 1st word only if original word was capital. Following words will always be capitalized.

 

Examples:

 

Function: camelCase("input", "delimiter")

 

"the-test-case" gets converted to "theTestCase"

"The_First_Word_Capital" gets converted to "TheFirstWordCapital"

 

Q2: Custom Parser:

 

Write a function which will parse input string as per below logic & return the output as array.

 

Consider initial value as 0

 

p : Adds up value by 1

m : reduces value by 1

s : square - like if value is 4 - it will become 16

o : saves the output in array to be returned.

 

Invalid char shall be skipped.

 

Ex:

parse("ppppsmoso") => [ 15, 225 ]

 

 

Q3: Find the missing alphabet:

 

write a function to find extra characters from the input string as per below logic, and return output as integer.

 

Legal characters are only a-n, consider case.

Any character beyond this range shall be counted as extra.

 

Ex:

aaabdbnhaikjjm --> 0

abaxbdbbyyhwawiwjjjwem --> 8
